# resolutions
A public list of my New Year's resolutions and goals.

## 2023

### [Public Progress Tracker](https://github.com/users/ledwards/projects/1/views/1)

**Personal:** This is going to be a special year, because I'm getting married in September! Accordingly, I've got some shredding for the wedding goals.

**Professional:** This is going to be an interesting year, because of...everything. Trying to figure out what my quantifiable goals this year will be. Edit to come.

### Fitness
I'm targeting some measurable outcomes in my Barry's Bootcamp routine.

#### Project Tracker
A number of goals start at 2022 Baseline. These are the weights and speeds I do comfortably, all the time. I don't even consider dropping below these, even if I'm tired or sore. These are the numbers I'm trying to increase!

I'll consider a metric the new baseline if I can do it every workout for 4 weeks. So there's a kanban column for each week I've been working on it. A goal only moves to a new week if it's been that many weeks *in a row* at that metric. If I mess up a week...well I guess I'll start it back at 1. If I can only do a certain metric every other week, it's not really a baseline, is it? It's still a stretch. Given how much I travel, I think I'll have to make an exception for that. Will have to see how that plays out.

Once I've done something four four weeks, I'll make it the new baseline and retire the goal/baseline it replaced. Hopefully, from there, I never go back.

Frankly, the milestone I care most about is where I'm at come September. So call that Q3. If all goes well, I'll be doing 5 Barry's workouts a week and I'll have moved up every weight and speed at least once, actually twice with a few exceptions.

### Work
WIP!

Some things I've measured in the past:
* pipeline metrics
  * emails -> first meetings -> beyond first meetings -> term sheets offered -> term sheets accepted
* top level metrics
  * deals done
  * deals won ratio
* specific learning goals (e.g. mobile, a specific ML course, books)
* number of books read on some topic
* calendar audit (% time spent on various things)
* company performance... this is maybe the one thing I can't make public, for obvious reasons
